## Description
University offers capstone projects to students with external industrial clients. 
The project manager assigns a team of 4 students to work as part of a capstone project 
team where external clients act as product owners. Students work for 16 weeks on such 
projects each semester.

There are many more clients than project teams, and teams are often formed 
in an ad hoc manner with a poor match between team members, between teams and projects 
resulting in a poor student and employer satisfaction. Moreover, the university 
regulation imposes specific constraints when forming teams. 

We have built a system which forms well-balanced teams, taking student and client 
preference in consideration, while implementing University imposed constraints. 
Our system allows extensibility, maintainability and reusability as the tool may be made available to 
other institutions.
